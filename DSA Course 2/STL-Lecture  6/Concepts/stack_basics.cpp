/*
Stack is data structure that works on LIFO(last in first out)

Allow elements to add or remove from one end only

std::stack class is container adapter , container objects stores similar data

we can create stack from sequence containers(vector,list,deque);if no container provide DEQUE by default

container adapter doesn't support iterators,manipulation of data not possible

header: <stack>

syntax: stack < obj_type > stack_name;
